                <h2> Web Designing</h2>
                <p> Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. 
                    The different areas of web design include web graphic design; interface design; authoring, including standardised code and 
                    proprietary software; user experience design; and search engine optimization. Often many individuals will work in teams covering different aspects of the design process,
                     although some designers will cover them all.The term web design is normally used to describe the design process relating to the front-end (client side) design of a website including writing markup. Web design partially overlaps web engineering in the broader scope of web development. Web designers are expected to have an awareness of usability and if
                      their role involves creating markup then they are also expected to be up to date with web accessibility guidelines.</p>

                      <p>
                            In 1996, Microsoft released its first competitive browser, which was complete with its own features and tags.
                             It was also the first browser to support style sheets,<span> and styles</span> which at the time was seen as an obscure authoring technique.[5] The HTML markup for tables was originally intended for displaying tabular data. However designers quickly realized the potential of using HTML tables for creating the complex, multi-column layouts that were otherwise not possible. At this time, as design and good aesthetics seemed to take precedence 
                            over good mark-up structure, and little attention was paid to semantics and web accessibility.

                            Web designers use a variety of different tools depending on what part of the production process they are involved in. These tools are updated over time by newer standards and software but the principles behind them remain the same. Web designers use both vector and raster graphics editors to create web-formatted imagery or design prototypes.
                             Technologies used to create websites include W3C standards like HTML and CSS, which can be hand-coded or
                              generated by WYSIWYG editing software. Other tools web designers might use include mark up validators[7] 
                              and other testing tools for usability and accessibility to ensure their websites meet web accessibility guidelines.

                  A postal service can be private or public, though many governments place restrictions on private systems.</p>
