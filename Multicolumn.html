            <p> After F. Orlin Tremaine was hired as editor in 1933, it became the leading magazine 
                in the nascent pulp science fiction field, with well-regarded stories such as Jack Williamson's 
                Legion of Space and "Twilight" by John W. Campbell. Campbell took over editorial duties from 1937 to 1971, 
                running many stories that became classics in the field, including Isaac Asimov's Foundation series, A. E. van Vogt's Slan, 
                and novels and stories by Robert A. Heinlein. By 1950, Astounding was no longer regarded as the leader in the field, though it
                 did continue to publish popular and influential stories, including Hal Clement's novel Mission of Gravity (1953) and Tom Godwin's 
                 "The Cold Equations" (1954). Ben Bova took over as editor from 1972 to 1978, winning five consecutive Hugo Awards. Trevor Quachri
                  currently edits the magazine for Crosstown Publications.</p>
            <p> Curiosity is a car-sized rover designed to explore the crater Gale on Mars as part of NASA's Mars Science Laboratory mission. It was launched from Cape Canaveral in November 2011 and landed on Aeolis Palus inside Gale on August 6, 2012, at 05:17 UTC.
                 Curiosity's landing site, nicknamed Bradbury Landing, was less than 2.4 km (1.5 mi) from the center of the rover's 
                touchdown target after a 560-million km (350-million mi) journey. The rover's goals include an investigation of the Martian
                 climate and geology; assessment of whether the selected field site inside Gale has ever offered environmental conditions favorable for
                  microbial life, including investigation of the role of water; as well as planetary habitability studies in preparation for human exploration.

                    This picture is a self-portrait of Curiosity on Mars at the "Big Sky" drilling site, where it collected a rock sample at the foothills
                     of Aeolis Mons (Mount Sharp) in October 2015. The photograph combines dozens of images taken by
                      the Mars Hand Lens Imager (MAHLI) camera at the end of the rover's robotic arm; the arm itself is not included, although its 
                      shadow is visible on the ground. Wrist motions and turret rotations on the arm allowed MAHLI to acquire the mosaic's component images.</p>
